Hello <%= @guest.name %>,

Just a quick update, there is no longer a need to bring <%= h(@thing.name)%> 
to <%= h(@guest.event.user.name)%>'s <%= "\"#{h(@guest.event.name)}\"" %> event.

You can select other things to bring by following this URL:
<%= @url %>

Thank you for your understanding.

Please do not reply to this email.

Best regards,
The Eventify Team.
